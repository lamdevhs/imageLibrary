= TODO

== Fixes
- [x] offensive indentation
- [x] window titles
- [x] commented code
- keySet()
- // TODOes
- SessionManager.this?
- check everything at the end
- condense unused methods

== Minimal objective

- [x] add/remove/create/delete tags
- [x] selecting images
- [x] show images' names
- [x] sort images by name/size

== Optional objectives

- unselect all
- create new tag from selection

== general
- [x] SessionUI -> SessionManager
- [x] get rid of sessionsList: redundancy is evil
- [x] TODO remove sessionIndex argument from nameSession()
- [x] put all the live data of the app inside a "appdata" subfolder
- [x] move "new" button of SessionManager to West panel
- [x] put all_sessions.xml outside sessions / folder
- [x] ? all_sessions.xml -> sessions.xml
- [ ] ? write accessor to get a session from its index? (and return null if fails)
- [ ] model must check all_sessions.xml doesn contain twice the same session name
- [ ] friendly message to guide the user in the session manager
- [ ] add button in session manager to change a session's folder
- [ ] check validity of SessionData before creating a session out of it!!!
- [ ] only add images whose relative paths truly put them in the given folder (aka no symlinks) +
  or... make so the relative path is the key unless it is a symlinked image
  (in which case we give its absolute path)
- [ ] create a demo_area, put the pics inside

- [x] user can choose zoom value
- [ ] remove TagsPanel.refreshLayout() and the corresponding Listener if not used in the end

== Model

- [x] reading/writing SessionFile
- [x] create Session
- [x] rename Session
- [x] delete Session

- [x] Observable

== Session Manager

- [x] folders
- [x] add/delete
- [ ] fix folders
- [x] warning when a folder can't be read
- [ ] ? view to manage folders
- [x] images from folders

== ImageModel

- [x] maybe allow ImageModels to know of the tags they are tagged with.
  It would make deleteOldImages() much more efficient,
  and it'll probably be useful at some further point.
