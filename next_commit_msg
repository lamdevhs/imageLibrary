Fix SessionManager closing on yes *and* on no

Before this commit :
When the user clicked on the cross to close the
SessionManager and quit the App, it would ask the
user for confirmation.
Yet if the user chose "no", App.quit() would
be cancelled, however the JFrame would still
vanish (due to default behavior).
