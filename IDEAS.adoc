= Ideas

== Session

- There could be just one folder per session, then the app extracts all the images from its subfolders.
- we check if a file is an image by trying to read an image from it (ImageIcon?)

== Tags

- user can choose what kind of automatic tags to create

== View

- vertical filter panel
- reverse order of images
- sort by height, width
